Dijkstra's Algorithm

single source shortest path algorithm
finds shortest path to every other node in the graph

1) add new node n with lowest cost to the solution set
2) for each node not in the solution set, the cost = min(current cost,cost from n+cost from n to the node)

uses priority queue, array-based heap
